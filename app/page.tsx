        <MotionH1>Feeling the Dialogue: Emotions and Morality in Scorsese & Tarantino Films</MotionH1>
        <MotionP>
          Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino are masters of modern cinema, known for their
          stylish crime narratives, morally complex characters, and unforgettable dialogue.
          Their films, such as Scorsese's <strong>Goodfellas</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} /> and <strong>Taxi Driver</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.TD} />, or Tarantino's <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> and <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 1</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.KB} />, often leave audiences grappling with questions of right and wrong,
          while simultaneously experiencing a whirlwind of emotions â€“ from humor and joy to
          intense anger and fear.
        </MotionP>
        <MotionP>
          This project dives into the emotional landscape of their characters' speech.
          Using computational tools like <strong>sentiment and emotion analysis</strong>, we explore how
          different characters in the iconic films <strong>Goodfellas</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} /> and <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> express
          emotions through their words. Can we find patterns? Do characters perceived as
          "villains" talk differently, emotionally speaking, than the "protagonists"?
        </MotionP>
        <MotionP>
          We started with a basic sentiment analysis tool (VADER<Cite id={REF_NUM.VADER} />) and then moved to a more
          advanced AI model (DistilRoBERTa<Cite id={REF_NUM.ROBERTA} />) to get a detailed breakdown of specific emotions
          like anger, joy, fear, and sadness. This white paper presents our findings,
          offering a data-driven look at how emotion and morality intertwine in the dialogue
          of these cinematic giants.

        <MotionH3>Why Analyze Dialogue in These Films?</MotionH3>
        <MotionP>
          Scorsese and Tarantino have distinct but influential styles. Both often feature:
        </MotionP>
        <MotionUl>
          <MotionLi>Characters operating outside the law (mobsters, hitmen, thieves).</MotionLi>
          <MotionLi>Dialogue that is sharp, memorable, and often reveals character psychology and motivations.</MotionLi>
          <MotionLi>Complex morality where heroes are flawed and villains can be charismatic.</MotionLi>
          <MotionLi>Sudden shifts in tone, mixing violence with dark humor or mundane conversation.</MotionLi>
        </MotionUl>
        <MotionP>
          Think of the tense diner scene in <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> or Tommy DeVito's "funny how?" rant
          in <strong>Goodfellas</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} />. The words characters choose, and the underlying emotion, are central
          to the impact of these films.
        </MotionP>
        <MotionH3>The Problem: Subjectivity vs. Data</MotionH3>
        <MotionP>
          Film analysis often relies on subjective interpretation. While valuable, it can be hard
          to make concrete comparisons. How much <strong>more</strong> angry does Tommy sound compared to Henry,
          according to their dialogue? Does <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong> truly have more 'surprising' moments
          reflected in its speech compared to <strong>Goodfellas</strong>? Traditional analysis struggles to quantify these emotional undercurrents at scale.
        </MotionP>
        <MotionP>
           This project addresses this gap by applying natural language processing (NLP)<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} /> techniques to treat the script's dialogue as data, allowing for measurable comparisons.
           Can we use data to provide objective, replicable insights into the emotional
           expression of characters and how it might relate to their roles and the film's overall tone?

        <MotionH2>Methodology: How I Analyzed the Dialogue</MotionH2>
        <MotionP>
          My process involved transforming the film scripts into analyzable data through several key steps using Python<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} /> and related libraries:
        </MotionP>

        <MotionH3 className="text-xl mt-6 mb-3 font-medium">1. Data Collection & Preparation</MotionH3> {/* Combined heading */}
        <MotionP>
          First, I obtained the text screenplays for <em>Pulp Fiction</em><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> and <em>Goodfellas</em><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} /> from public online databases<Cite id={REF_NUM.SCRIPTS} />. Using Python<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} />, I then wrote code to parse these files, extracting dialogue spoken by key characters (Vincent, Jules, Mia, Butch; Henry, Tommy, Jimmy). This involved cleaning the text by removing non-spoken elements like stage directions. The result was a structured dataset containing the film, character, and the cleaned dialogue line, ready for analysis.

        <MotionH3>Analysis Step 1: Basic Sentiment with VADER</MotionH3> {/* Changed heading slightly */}
        <MotionP>
          My first pass used <strong>VADER</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.VADER} />.
          VADER is a lexicon and rule-based tool good for general sentiment, especially text with slang or emphasis (like social media or dialogue). It efficiently provides a single 'compound' score from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive), giving a broad measure of polarity.

          <strong>Limitations:</strong> While quick, VADER's single score lacked detail. It couldn't differentiate *types* of negative emotions (anger vs. sadness) and often scored nuanced dialogue as neutral. For deeper insights, a more sophisticated approach was needed.

        <MotionP>
          To get a richer understanding, I employed a powerful AI model based on <strong>RoBERTa</strong> (<code>j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base</code><Cite id={REF_NUM.ROBERTA} /> via Hugging Face<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} />). This model analyzes text contextually and classifies it into seven distinct emotion categories:

        {/* Emotion List */}
        <MotionUl className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-x-4 mb-4">

        {/* Implementation Details */}
        <MotionP>
          I applied this model using the Transformers<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} /> and PyTorch<Cite id={REF_NUM.LIBS} /> libraries, optimizing performance with batch processing and hardware acceleration (MPS). This generated the detailed emotion scores used in the main results section.

            <strong>Insights:</strong> 'Neutral' is the most frequent dominant emotion for many characters, including Henry (46%), Butch (40%), Mia (51%), and Vincent (45%), indicating much dialogue serves exposition or basic interaction. However, the exceptions are telling: For Jimmy, <strong>'anger'</strong> was dominant in a remarkable 43% of his lines, far exceeding any other emotion for him. For Tommy, <strong>'anger'</strong> (30%) and 'neutral' (25%) were the most frequent dominant emotions. Jules also showed <strong>'anger'</strong> as dominant frequently (26%), second only to 'neutral' (35%). This highlights how even if the <strong>average</strong> intensity isn't always extreme, certain characters express specific dominant emotions much more often.

This confirms that the more nuanced model generally agrees with VADER's polarity but adds detail. We also observe a strong negative correlation between predicted <strong>'anger'</strong> and <strong>'neutral'</strong> (-0.52), indicating the model clearly distinguishes these states. Interestingly, <strong>'surprise'</strong> shows very little correlation with the overall VADER sentiment score (0.04).

             <MotionP className="mt-4">
            <strong>Insights:</strong> These specific examples show the model often aligns well with explicit textual cues (Butch's "Shut up!" scoring high on 'anger', Jules' dialogue about dietary preferences scoring high on 'disgust'). The high 'anger' score for Jules's Ezekiel passage<Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> likely reflects the text's inherent intensity and violent context, even if the character's delivery is controlled.
         </MotionP>
         <MotionP>
          However, comparing these peaks to the overall averages reveals a fascinating contrast. Our earlier analysis showed <strong>Goodfellas</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} /> characters, particularly Jimmy and Tommy, possessing higher <strong>average</strong> scores for negative emotions like anger, disgust, and fear. Yet, as seen above, the dialogue lines receiving the absolute <strong>highest</strong>, most extreme scores for these same emotions predominantly originate from <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} />.
         </MotionP>
         <MotionP>
           This suggests potentially different stylistic approaches. The consistently higher negative averages in <strong>Goodfellas</strong> could reflect the pervasive tension, cynicism, and threat normalized within the mob environment Scorsese portrays â€“ a constant, simmering baseline of negativity. Tarantino, on the other hand, might utilize moments of extreme emotional intensity in dialogue more <strong>selectively</strong> but with maximum textual force, creating sharp, impactful peaks (like Jules's righteous fury or sudden outburst) for dramatic or stylistic effect within a film that might otherwise have more varied emotional states. It highlights how average emotional tone differs from the intensity of emotional peaks in dialogue.
         </MotionP>
         <MotionP>
           Of course, some results remain less intuitive (e.g., Vincent's 'fear' score for "Let's shake on it"), reminding us that the model interprets textual patterns and doesn't fully capture human subtext, irony, or performance nuance, which are vital parts of the cinematic experience.

          insights... By moving from basic sentiment analysis (VADER<Cite id={REF_NUM.VADER} />) to fine-grained emotion classification (using a RoBERTa-based model<Cite id={REF_NUM.ROBERTA} />), we uncovered
          nuanced patterns in how characters in <strong>Goodfellas</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.GF} /> and <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong><Cite id={REF_NUM.PF} /> express emotion...

        We found observable, measurable differences in characters' emotional profiles that often align with their established narrative roles and personalities â€“ for instance, the significantly higher average and dominant 'anger' expressed by antagonists like Jimmy. Furthermore, the overall emotional "fingerprints" of the two films showed subtle but distinct characteristics. This data-driven approach complements traditional film analysis by providing objective evidence based directly on the script's text.
